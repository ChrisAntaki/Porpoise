# Porpoise

A client library for the Purpose Platform

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PurposeOpen/Porpoise.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PurposeOpen/Porpoise)


### Try it!

Try a demo of the Purpose Platform and a movement site running on it (using Porpoise) here:

Platform:  
[https://platform-dev-demo.herokuapp.com](https://platform-dev-demo.herokuapp.com)  
login: `admin@example.com`  
password: `developers3x`

Movement:  
[https://movement-dev-demo.herokuapp.com](http://movement-dev-demo.herokuapp.com)

These apps may need a minute to warm up on your first request because they are running on Heroku's free tier.
